This is a project intended for practice with javascript. The only HTML included will serve to link the javascript file. There will be no CSS. The game will be played exclusively in the console.

The only specified handling for robustness is the ability to accept any method of capitalization from user input.

This project was great for practicing javascript. There are many features that would improve the program, but as the main purpose is practice I only included logic to check for inputs that were not the 3 options above.The programming seems to be quite tedious to read but it is a solution nonetheless.
